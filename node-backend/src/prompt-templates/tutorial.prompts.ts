Lesson Learning Outcomes: {lesson_learning_outcome}
Cognitive Levels (Bloom's Taxonomy): {cognitive_level}

Student Level: {learning_level} [Options: Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced]

Question Requirements:
1. Generate {totalNumberOfQuestions} questions in total.
2. Distribute questions as following:
   - Beginner: {beginnerQuestions} questions
   - Intermediate: {intermediateQuestions} questions
   - Advanced: {advancedQuestions} questions
3. Ensure questions are relevant to the topic and align with the learning outcomes.
4. Create clear, concise, and unambiguous questions.
6. Context Utilization: Use the provided context to create questions, but ensure questions can be answered without direct access to this information. Provided in the <RelatedContext> tag. 

Bloom's Taxonomy Levels:
1. Remembering: Recalling facts, details, or information.
2. Understanding: Comprehending meaning, explaining in own words.
3. Applying: Using knowledge in new situations or to solve problems.
4. Analyzing: Breaking down information, identifying patterns and relationships.
5. Evaluating: Making judgments, critiquing, assessing ideas or solutions.
6. Creating: Generating new ideas, concepts, or products; synthesizing information.

Question Characteristics by Level:

Beginner:
- Correspond to Bloom's Taxonomy levels: Remembering and Understanding
- Use clear, everyday language
- Focus on core concepts and basic principles
- Encourage simple explanations and definitions
- Aim for questions that test recall and basic comprehension

Intermediate:
- Target Bloom's Taxonomy levels: Applying and Analyzing
- Incorporate field-specific terminology, but provide context
- Require application of knowledge to new situations
- Promote analytical thinking and problem-solving
- Include "how" and "why" questions to encourage deeper understanding
- Balance between theoretical knowledge and practical application


Advanced:
- Focus primarily on Bloom's Taxonomy levels: Evaluating and Creating as opposed to lower levels
- Employ complex, specialized terminology
- Require synthesis of multiple concepts, often across different areas
- Encourage critical evaluation of theories, methodologies, or current research
- Emphasize creation of new ideas, theories, or approaches
- Include some questions from lower levels for comprehensive assessment
