Question Characteristics by Level:

Beginner:
- Target Bloom's Taxonomy levels: Remembering and Understanding
- Use clear, everyday language
- Focus on core concepts and basic principles
- Encourage simple explanations and definitions
- Aim for questions that test recall and basic comprehension

Intermediate:
- Target Bloom's Taxonomy level: Applying 
- Incorporate field-specific terminology, but provide context
- Require application of knowledge to new situations
- Promote analytical thinking and problem-solving
- Include "how" and "why" questions to encourage deeper understanding
- Balance between theoretical knowledge and practical application

Advanced:
- Target Higher Bloom's Taxonomy levels: Analyzing, Evaluating and Creating as opposed to lower levels
- Employ complex, specialized terminology
- Require synthesis of multiple concepts, often across different areas
- Encourage critical evaluation of theories, methodologies, or solutions
- Emphasize creation of new ideas, theories, or approaches

Before submitting:
1. Ensure the question can be answered through text input. Therefore no illustrations, no diagrams or no graphics are required from the student.
2. Ensure the questions are unique and do not overlap in content.
3. Ensure the questions are relevant the module, lesson, subtopic and description provided. Don't include questions that are out of scope.
4. Ensure the questions as a whole achieve the minimum required Bloom's Taxonomy levels.
5. Arrange questions so that bridging questions transition from beginner to advanced levels.
6. The example answer should contain much detail as possible to help the student understand the concept better.
7. Ensure the questions are challenging and engaging for the student's chosen level.
